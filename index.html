<div id="title">Floating</div>
<div class="para">
<div>I don't have a home in big cities, even though almost half of my life before my twenty six yrs that I lived in big cities, so I'm a truely floating person, and floating is already became one of my personalities.</div>
<iframe width=50% height="501" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ahWLUp_FWew" title="Will Smith is Homeless - Looking For Shelter in THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<div id="alignwithfilm">In my childhood, in my best hometown, I watched a film named "The Pursuit of Happiness", and it was moved me so much, and also let me became curious about the world outside. And I still remmered one of the scenes in the film, the father(both in film and reality, because the actors are Will Smith&Jaden Smith) cheat his little-aged son that said the public toilet is a cave, and they time-travel to the pre-history, even dinosaurs were walking through them, the truth is they became homeless.</div>
<div>
When the first time I watched this part, I just empathized the hardness of their. However I have different feeling now after servel years floating life, which I can't remmbered how many times I moved to another house, from longest four years to shortest ten days rent. I feel like I can't live a stable life again, so I say that <span class="bold"> floating is already becoming one of my personalities.</span>
<div class="blank"></div>
<ul>This personality has many features.

<li>Never buy things that need take a place in home. In another words, everything I bought should be functioanl on every part of them, as a result, I hate anything embellished, which it's even affect me on font using, I wouldn't use serif fonts.</li>
<li>
A bag or a lugage that contains everything I needed to keep me alive, and it should be sort up within fifteen minues. 
</li>
<li>Never travel if I have a place to live, because I don't know when I have to travel</li>
<li>Save everything online as I can</li>
<li>Don't din in if I can take away, because the cozy atomosphere in resturant may discourage me from working</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<div class="blank"></div>
<div>It's sound like a terrible life, but actually it's not that bad
</div>
<div>I'm questioning my sexuality, at least those years, which means I wouldn't pursuit the happniess like in the film from raising a child, or pursite a stable life isn't the goal of mine, as I don't really find a place or people, job to let me feel I need stay there in rest of my life.</div>

<div>Especially, in some spike moments, I would say <span class="bold"> I like live in this way.</span></div>
